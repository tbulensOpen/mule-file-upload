Features to added to learning project:

( Done ) 1) Injecting run time properties, environment properties, and application properties.
         See ${project.dir}/references/PropertiesRuntime.htm
           a) Created separate module to externalize environment properties to be shared across multiple systems.
              properties module: default-environment.properties file in its resources package.
           b) file-upload module has a provided dependency of properties module.
           c) file-upload module has a application env.properties that uses the default-environment.properties
           d) See mule-config how to use both the default-environment.properties along with the env.properties.

2) Multiple versions of the same application running side by side.
3) Security
4) Performance testing
5) Concurrency
6) Large number of applications running side by side.
7) Different versions of jars on different applications ( to prove no class path collisions )
8) Demonstrate Spring Bean pooling. Multiple instances of a spring bean loaded and processing concurrently.
   Explain when and why pooling is needed.
